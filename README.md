<h1 align="center">Masters in Data science at University of minnesota</h1>
<br>
I'm currently pursuing my Master of Data Science from University of minnesota(Fall 2021 - spring 2023) and it is considered as one of the best courses that offers in-depth learning in a Data Science and Business Intelligence and has consistently made its place among the top global universities. It is a regular, two-year (31 credits) master's program integrates a strong foundation in big data and analysis.
